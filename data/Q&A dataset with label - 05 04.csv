,,What is consumer impact,Consumer impact describes average sales price minus the regulators’ revenue per unit of goods sold
,,How is revenue from each firm calculated,"Revenue from each firm is calculated using tax, permit payments, or no policy or direct regulation depending on the round"
,,How does a higher heterogeneity of production factors affect the difference between the tax scenarios and quantity-based regulation,"A higher heterogeneity of production factors makes the compositional change towards more emission-efficient firms less sensitive to price fluctuations, which reduces the difference between the tax scenarios and quantity-based regulation"
,,How does the emission price adaption rate affect the technology adoption for the tax scenarios and downstream direct regulation,"The emission price adaption rate decreases technology adoption for the tax scenarios, and increases it for downstream direct regulation Lower emission price adaption rates reduce the magnitude of the ‘overshoot-decline’ dynamic of quantity-based regulation, causing higher technology adoption in the tax scenarios"
,,What parameters are particularly sensitive under downstream direct regulation,Increased technology adoption and decreased compositional change with high abatement cost factor θ and demand sensitivity γ are particularly sensitive under downstream direct regulation
,,What other sensitivities are found for all scenarios,"The demand response to prices γ, the pro-duction cost increase β, the abatement cost factor θ affect the results in all scenarios"
,,What is the initial production factors in the simulation,The initial production factors are set to 1
,,What is the minimum and maximum values of the price sensitivity of demand,"The minimum and maximum values of the price sensitivity of demand are 04 and 05, respectively"
,,What is the definition of policy evaluation criteria and additional indicators in Table Appendix 3,"The policy evaluation criteria and additional indicators in Table Appendix 3 are Technology adoption, Compositional change, Production decline, Sales price, Consumer impact, Emissions, Emission price, Upstream profit rate, Downstream profit rate, Upstream Market concentration, and Downstream Market concentration"
,,What kind of sensitivity indices were applied to full coverage in J Foramitti et al Technological Forecasting & Social Change 1722021 121060,The Sobol sensitivity indices were applied to full coverage in J Foramitti et al Technological Forecasting & Social Change 172 2021 121060
,,What does the IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 15∘C above pre-industrial levels examine,"The IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 15∘C above pre-industrial levels examines the related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty"
,,What is the focus of Mullainathan and Thaler's 2000 paper on Behavioral Economics,The focus of Mullainathan and Thaler's 2000 paper on Behavioral Economics is to examine how psychology affects economic decisions Paltsev and Capros' 2013 paper on Cost Concepts for Climate Change Mitigation examines the cost of mitigation measures and their impacts on policy decisions
,,What are the types of carbon lock-in identified by Seto et al 2016,"Seto et al 2016 identified five types of carbon lock-in technology lock-in, infrastructure lock-in, institutional lock-in, behavioral lock-in and cultural lock-in"
,,What methods did Saltelli et al 2010 develop to analyse model output,Saltelli et al 2010 developed methods to analyse model output using variance based sensitivity analysis and the total sensitivity index
,,What is the Green Paradox,The Green Paradox is a supply-side approach to global warming which suggests that the introduction of certain policies intended to reduce emissions may paradoxically lead to an increase in emissions
,,What type of models are used to calculate global sensitivity indices,Monte Carlo estimates are used to calculate global sensitivity indices for nonlinear mathematical models
,,What type of research does Ivan Savin focus on,"Ivan Savin focuses on climate policy analysis, agent-based modeling, and the question of human wellbeing within environmental limits"
,,What is the title of Ivan Savin's habilitation thesis,Ivan Savin's habilitation thesis is titled Applications of Evolutionary Optimization and Modelling in Economics
,,What is Prof Dr Jeroen CJM van den Bergh's current position,Prof Dr Jeroen CJM van den Bergh is currently an ICREA Research Professor at the Institute of Environmental Science & Technology at Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona and an Honorary Professor of Environmental & Resource Economics in the School of Economics & Business and the Institute for Environmental Studies at VU University Amsterdam
